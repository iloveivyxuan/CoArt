# CoArt
A programming educational tool within hybrid programming environment and visual art context

# Abstract
CoArt, a computer science (CS) educational tool in a text-enhanced, block-based programming environment, is designed for young students to learn the fundamentals of computer programming within a visual art context. Prior research showed that choosing visual programming languages, or hybrid programming languages that combine both visual and textual language, as young students’ first programming language can have positive effects to stimulate students’ interest in CS. The goal of this work is to foster young students' interest in computer science via a simple learning interface that teaches programming logic and enables artistic expression through programming.
