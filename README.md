# CreativeArt
Computer Science Education tool based on generative art and block based programming

Notes:
- It's usually difficult for a bignner learn programming and processing APIs at the same time. So I have to teach one thing at a time. I should not provide too much new stuff at each time.
- I can put a challenge at the end of each chapter to make sure users understand this chapter.
- I need to convey that programing/coding is to solve problem or realize an idea.

# Tutorial (Draft Version)
### Chapter One - Hello World
- Challenge 1: draw a circle at center of the Canvas
- Challenge 2: fill the circle with color
- Challenge 3: set border to the circle
- Challenge 4: Understand to draw an ellipse width, height, position is necessary but filling color, stroke, or stroke weight is optional. (Guess why?)
- Challenge 5: Understand function, argument, and statement. For a function, argument is necessary. fill, stroke, stroke weight are other functions that are optional to add or remove.
- Challenge 6: Show codes; try to delete one line or change argument to see what happens
- Final challenge: use ellipse blocks to draw a picture (provide demo, can switch between code and block)

### Chapter Two -
