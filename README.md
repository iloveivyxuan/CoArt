# CreativeArt
Computer Science Education tool based on generative art and block based programming

# Tutorial (Draft Version)
### Chapter One - Hello World
- Challenge 1: draw a circle at center of the Canvas
- Challenge 2: fill the circle with color
- Challenge 3: set border to the circle
- Challenge 4: Understand to draw an ellipse width, height, position is necessary but filling color, stroke, or stroke weight is optional. (Guess why?)
- Challenge 5: Understand function, argument, and statement. For a function, argument is necessary. fill, stroke, stroke weight are other functions that are optional to add or remove.
- Challenge 6: Show codes; try to delete one line or change argument to see what happens
- Challenge 7 Final challenge: use ellipse blocks to draw a picture (provide demo, can switch between code and block)
